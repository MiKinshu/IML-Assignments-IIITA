Pros

3 Clean and Big Rooms
4 Clean Washroom
5 Good Hospitality
Cons
The only thing that bothered me that the room that was given to me was an AC room and since I opted for no AC , it was kept off - so it doesn't had any window for ventilation, at times I needed to keep the main door open for some time for ventilation. If you are booking the AC room, then it should not be a problem.

2. Courteous and helpful staff.
3. even though there is no lift they have people who will pick and drop ur baggage.
4. I stayed at a family suite which is quite big for 3 people. it had 2 seperate rooms with bathrooms and cupboards.

I am staying in HPR from so long. But this time it was more amazing because I booked deluxe and got super deluxe 😁😁😁😁😁 room was very much spacious and I enjoyed a lot and thats why I am writing this review.
