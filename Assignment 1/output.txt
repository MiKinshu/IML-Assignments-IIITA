Review 1 : the stay was awesome i enjoyed a lot because of its amazing houses with a spacious rooms even bathroom feels like a room. Must stay i will stay there only in jagdalpur. Such a marvelous designed houses were a great one among the other sites of jagdalpur.
As a couple i feel free to stay there without any fear. Security is good, even i like the food also.
Review 2 : The location is quite good and easy to reach and locate from NH. The rooms we stayed were deluxe and were very spacious. There was a hall, a bedroom and two bathrooms in addition to a 1st floor balcony.
Room service and breakfast was fair .... not too much in menu and neither too less.
We tasted mutton biryani and bhuna mutton and on both days the mutton was not cooked properly. That's the only negative part.
Overall stay was comfortable and special thanks to Anjali for helping out everything for our infant.
Safe ambience. Lots of place for taking a walk and for infants play.

Review 2 : Considering being a 4 Star hotel the neat and cleanliness of the hotel and facilities provided its quite good. Breakfast was having a lot of options and they were tasty too.
The location of the hotel quite far from the main city and tourist places, so you get a great view from the Restaurant. And maybe from some of the rooms which were facing towards that side.
But they need to improve upon the arrival experience of the customers as I felt all staffs were busy arranging for a Marriage Function ...more

Review 1 : It was an amazing experience at this Palace Resort. The rooms were great with a nice view. Also, the hospitality was quiet nice. Morning breakfast and the roof top dinner is something you cannot miss at Radisson. The pool is at a nice location. Great Stay overall.
Good place for a family vacation where you can enjoy all the activities at the resort, for eg. the local dances, archery, etc. Also, there are lot of places where you can click good pictures. The hotel gives you a fantastic view of the Fateh Sagar Lake.
Review 2 : Stayed for one night during our visit to Udaipur. The hospitality and staff were good. Smooth check-in process. The room was nice with all the amenities in perfect condition. We had our dinner at Neel Mahal which is one of the 3 restaurants at the property and the food did not disappoint. Nice view of the Fatehsagar lake from the rooftop restaurant. The buffet breakfast spread was quite extensive and tasty.

Review 1 : A good place in bani park right next to inox and walking from some great pubs and restaurants - perfect for the youngsters. The rooms were good with nice space, the service was good too. A couple lf issues if you can live with that - 1. Only veg food, 2. The staff seems a bit stingy but i guess guidelines set by the management- only 1 room key policy, also didnt give bottled water the 3rd day as it was day of checkout, instead filled RO water.
Overall - i had a nice experience with the staff, with quick service and cordial attitude.
Review 2 : thoroughly liked the stay. rooms were tidy and beddings were clean . room service was great. they provided iron when asked for.
food in the restaurant was delicious and all veg ( thing which I liked the most) breakfast buffet included in the package consisted of variety of cuisines.

Review 2 : We had a great time there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms were however small but did all the basic needs. It is situated really close to Taragarh fort, hence one would just need to walk to reach the fort.
Also dont forget to check their rooftop resturant in the night for stargazing and amazing view of Taragarh fort.
Stargazing at night, morning breakfast with Taragarh fort view and langurs who just chill around at the domes and chattris of heritage building. ( They are harmless, click a photo or eat infront of them and they still mind their own buisness).

Review 1 : Kadam Kunj Resort is located just off the Bharatpur to Fatepur Sikri Road. It's quite a calm and quiet place with very spacious rooms, clean and tidy. Bathroom are good. The food is good but take a long time to arrive so order early. Staff is courteous and serve you well. Overall a great stay.
We generally go out to visit cities of historical importance, monuments, nature trails and beaches. preferably like to drive
Review 2 : Our experience has been mixed. It's a good property totally mismanaged
Positives are
Nice location, property is decent, nice pool, neat and clean rooms
Negative:
oily food, we had to go out and eat on all days.
Our room lock got struck up. They could not open for 2 hours. Finally had to broken. Slow response from staff
Not hot water in the morning. Most tourist go early to bird sanctuary, so it's crazy that they forgot to switch off water heating system
We had asked for packed lunch in the morning as we were visiting sanctuary. They forgot
Overall a good property poorly managed

Review 1 : I stayed at the hotel for two nights with family. The location of the hotel was very good near shopping centre. The room was big and complete with all amenities. Bed-sheet, pillows, blankets and towels were clean. Room service was very good. The staff were well behaved. The toilet was good enough but without any geyser. Supply of hot water reportedly was available from boiler after 1 pm. Who would wait so long without going out for sight-seeing?
Their restaurant though provided good foods at reasonable rate but was not sufficiently clean and hygienically maintained.
Review 2 : Hotel stay was good overall. when we checked in, bedsheets were not cleaned properly. but when we asked they changed immediately. Breakfast is good but service is very slow. Rooftop restaurant was also good.

Also the water in swimming pool was hot and stinking .A little extra care is required there , as almost all the people make use of it .

The only con I found was the food. Since, there is nothing in the close vicinity, one has to choose eating all his meals in the hotel. The quantity of the meal wasn't enough for two people. Also, the food wasn't anything to look upto. Though the complimentary breakfast was good.
Also, the person at the reception wasn't affable.

Travelers should reach there by 4 pm and should move for Camel ride and enjoy the sun set. This is included in their package.
Next day you can go for jeep safari at a reasonable cost and enjoy the sunrise. They also organise small trips to Tanot Ma ...more

Review 1 : Rooms and washrooms are good and clean upto the mark. Very courteous staff. Nice location of the hotel. Food is also good here. Though the rooms are bit smaller but they have utilized the space very well. They provided the kettle but there was no plug for it in the room. We had to use the one in washroom near the sink. They dont provide tea coffee with the electric kettle so better buy them from outside.
In all they deserve a full star rating.
Review 2 : Location was superb to this hotel, very close to Jaisalmer Fort. Room was neat and clean. new hotel, new room with all the basic facilities. Staff was also very courteous and nice to us.

We went for a complimentary boat ride late afternoon, with stunning bird watching. My friend treated himself to a head massage in the peaceful aryeuvedic centre, where we were greeted by Dr. Sreenath a lovely aryeuvedic doctor.Dr. Sreenath is a very caring Ayurvedic doctor and his treatment was effective. The food was delicious - the breakfast dosas come highly recommendedresort.

There s plenty to do inside the resort premises...
Inside a rainforest...
Good food, trained and well behaved people all around to help you...
Clean rooms with all amenities...
Pool view, forest view restaurant...
Overall we enjoyed the stay...
Review 2 : Elixir is a perfect getaway place in case you're looking for a relaxing and soothing stay in the midst of nature. It's in a tropical forest setup with tress right up to your balcony. The misty hills of Munnar won't be visible to you amid the wilderness and you might want to consider that before booking. Service and restaurant is great as expected. Jacuzzi is nice and the rooms are pretty cosy. Lot of space to roam around in the property so you might as well spend a few days here.
The rooms are very cosy and the jacuzzi added a lot of fun to our stay.

Review 2 : I stayed with my family. We were in all six adults and three children and had booked three rooms. We had also stayed there about 9 years back and had sweet memories so had decided to again stay at the same place. It is a very decent resort, with good amenities and excellent location. Buffet breakfast is lavish and other facilities are also praiseworthy. Staff is very well behaved and prompt.

- For hot water gyser could be setup in each washroom as central gyser for hot water was not working

About the food it's good enough but the rooms are just what they are pictured to be -great interiors, spacious and clean the same goes for the bathrooms. You can get a direct vein of Vaishno Devi from the balcony. All in all I'm glad I chose Rama Trident.

The rooms and amenities were decent. Wifi was not working during our stay. We had no option other than having dinner at the hotel due to its remote location. The food was also decent but they overcharged for it.
Overall just an OK experience for us. We would recommend do a day trip to Gulmarg from Srinagar instead of staying back at Gulmarg.
Review 2 : It's a very nice hotel. If you are not looking for a 5-star but just a nice and clean hotel for accommodation, this one is more than better. It has clean rooms, good lawn where you can have your breakfast and a very nice food. Overall it was a pleasant stay and would definitely recommend someone looking out for a budget hotel.

Review 1 : Average Hotel with Awesome View
It is an average hotel with basic facilities and an anazing view. Situated in the main market so basic amenities are accessible.Service is good with a responsive staff.
Review 2 : a good, value for money hotel. great ambience and nice rooms. rooms have ac and 24 hours hot water facility. Lal chowk is 10 minutes by auto rickshaw. the hotel is bit off the road and thus no traffic sounds in the hotel vicinity. the location is not great I would say as we didn't find any good restaurants in the approachable walking distance. so, had to rely on the hotel restaurant food. the food was average. staff is cooperative.

Review 2 : Staying here for the 2nd time...and I have to say that it is the most serene place on Earth. The most outstanding feature of this property is it's location. It is on the banks of the Lidder river. And when I say banks...it means you are literally sleeping mtrs away from the busy river which is always in full flow. Add great service to the great location and you would want to come back to this place again & again...

Review 1 : - Location is undoubtedly very good. Nature all around. Snow capped mountains right in front.
- Food is average. Costly for me when I compare it in terms of taste and presentation. Chilly Paneer was good.
- New owners who took over recently in Dec-2019. So, in coming months, probably things will improve considerably.
- Owners and his family was kind enough to help us with the arrangement for bday cake and things for my friend who was traveling with me.
As a family, we enjoyed a lot.
Review 2 : Our overall experience with this property was amazing we enjoyed a lot & relaxed the staff were very much polite & food was also tasty the surroundings of the resort is very beautiful nature is all around we would love to go there again the owner of the property Mr. Tiwari ji is also very much gentle person we highly recommend this property to everyone it's really worth it.

Review 2 : A very nice place amidst the greens of Ranikhet. Calm and Serene. It is an old heritage bungalow converted to resort.
Only issue I had is they arranged for a private bon-fire for someone. Since it is a small place which can't have multiple bonfires, I'd have expected a single event for all the guests (could have been opt-in with nominal payment) not something like a private event which others are not allowed (but definitely get the disturbance free as music would be heard in your room)

Review 1 : Nice place to spend vacation lonely since the place is secluded from the Ranikhet market place and it would burn out your pocket if you desire to move around Ranikhet . Ideal place if one is in search of seclusion from worldly tides. Disruptive internet and mobile connection. No facility of Television in Camps. The services of the people in charge of the camp place was good enough. No officer or agent of the camp bliss was available though it is not a complaint just information. Place is not ...more
Review 2 : Good place, very good location. Service is also good and food is delicious. Only minus point is no network coverage and no wifi. No tv in room also. For some people these points are not valid however for family with kid I think these points are valid. Ideal location for groups however for single family tv or wifi should be there.

Review 1 : The hotel was value for money overall and the location was perfect. Har ki paudi is at walking distance. And you will cab or bus transport dealers very near to the hotel. Also, the auto stand is at walking distance. As the hotel is in the main market you never have to worry about the food. Just go out and enjoy the local food of North India.
But, there is one thing I didn't like was the hot water in the bathroom. We travelled in the first week of December and the hotel could not able to provide hot water for bathing. Overall it the only 3 star hotel near had ki paudi, so do try this property.
Review 2 : This was nice Hotel, location of hotel was very good. Har ki pauri was just walking distance of 10min, Mansa Devi Temple Ropeway was just 5 min and Haridwar railway station and bus stand just 10min by Rikshaw. Hotel was in the middle of market, Restaurant and many eateries were near by.
Hotel staff was also cooperative and good. I didn't face any problems during check in and check out.
Hotel Alpana is nice Hotel in reasonable price.

Review 1 : The good things to start with - the hotel is beautifully located with great views. The staff is very friendly. Adequate hot water and good water pressure. Now the not so good things - Very poor maintenance, inadequate heating (for winters), poor food quality, breakfast spread is very poor.
Review 2 : The hotel is an awesome place to be in Mussoorie. The view from the rooms and restaurant are very good. It gives a complete view of Mussoorie and you can see Dehradun too.
The hotel manager is very friendly and he helps out a lot on the local sight seeing planning. They have a free drop and pickup in their gypsy from Mall Road everyday. The restaurant staff was friendly and the food is also awesome.

Review 1 : hotel stay was nice. Awesome view from the spacious room . staff was polite and courteous.. they have a kids play room.
Breakfast was realy good and fresh.
only Concerns.
Firstly Distance from Mall road is Around 2.5 kms. If you have a vehicle than its not an issue.
second is the network here in the room are weak and they provide wifi for an hour only.
So if you're looking for a peaceful stay with a spl one or even with a family. I would highly recommend it.
Review 2 : It is a good and clean property.. the mall road is 15-20 min drove from the hotel. Breakfast buffet is average, taste and quality needs improvement . Staff is very helpful.. outdoor activities are really good .
Overall a good stay .

Review 1 : Nice place to stay. About a km from Mallital side of the lake, situated right on the mall road; Walking distance towards Tallital side. Excellent view from rooms. No issues on service or cleaniness. Nothing less when compared with similar budget hotels on mall road. Rather better than some of them. Deluxe lake view room on three floors and family suite on fourth. Good view from all four floors but higher the better. Food from restaurant is slightly coslier but no compromises on quality.
Review 2 : Location is very good. It's near to bus stand, located on Mall Road and it's fairly huge Hotel, easily traceable..
We paid almost double of normal room to buy lake view room but it was not wroth because room had one window, without black film and had a curtain only. So if u want to enjoy the lake view from your room. Be assured that some can peep inside your room.
Moreover, on list it's Delux but size of the room was small. On complaining about the room size they said you can change to super delux but have to pay more.

Review 2 : A very average kind of hotel with two good things - location and food. Now if I mention breakfast(food) let me tell you in 250/- they only give 3 options in veg and second day you will find same options in breakfast. Talking about hotel - owner is also not at all welcoming! With almost no expressions he is least concerned about guests.
Very poor service from eating in restaurant to room service. Staff do everything for tip. Also, room size is very small!

Also the room service are not available and room quality not standard. You can only enjoy if you're bechelor and want some party with bonfire and beer then one day is ok.

The rooms looked spacious. However, there were some minor glitches one has to overlook in this part of the country, for eg., AC without remote, geyser not working, walls with cobwebs. The cleaning part was unprofessional. But one goes to such places to enjoy and shouldn't bother upon such minor issues. Right?
The kitchen is appreciable. Whatever we ordered was cooked and ...more
Review 2 : hotel is on the sea beach, enjoyed our stay in the cottage..awesome food..value for money.. we stayed for 2night 3days ..
only thing that was disappointing was the door locks, not working properly. otherwise it was a pleasant stay there..

2. Swimming pool is not available for whole day. Opend for limited time. This can be kept open at least 08AM to 5PM.

I have stayed in other hotels and checked lots of others here and I must say that this is one of the best hotels. My rating of 4 start is totally based on standards of hotels available in Mandarmani and should not be considered on the basis of national or international hotel standards and in that case I would give it a 2 star.

There is also no pick n drop facility provided by the Hotel to railway station which is barely a kilometer and half is again a spoiler.

3 Clean and Big Rooms
4 Clean Washroom
5 Good Hospitality
Cons
The only thing that bothered me that the room that was given to me was an AC room and since I opted for no AC , it was kept off - so it doesn't had any window for ventilation, at times I needed to keep the main door open for some time for ventilation. If you are booking the AC room, then it should not be a problem.
Overall, its a very nice hotel for family, group of friends, couples at 1km distance from the Mathura Jn railway station.

IMPROVEMENT Areas :- The toiletries IN the suit room is Not as all up to the mark. The quality is very low as per the cost of the room per night. Very low quality like a normal sub budget hotel.
APPRECIATION :- Front off reception staff very warm and cordial.

the attitude of over the counter staff is threatening.

Bright sunlight beams thru that window and u cannot have a proper sleep.
laundry service was delayed n on top of that the clothes were wet even in the normal sunny days.

Review 1 : We stayed at this place on 24th March. The food quality at lunch was good. Rooms were neat and clean. Location is excellent.
Observed one unique bad habit of hotel staff. We had booked 3 rooms and surprisingly, the AC switch ( which is outside rooms ) was switched off for all 3 rooms early in the morning. These low grade tactics to cut costing left bad experience in mind which could otherwise have easily been excellent experience. On enquiry, the manager available on desk had no clue and answer to this poor strategy of switching off the AC.
Review 2 : Very nice stay at goverdhan hotel, warm welcome from the staff, clean room, Hot shower, clean sheet and towels, soap and shzmpoo samples, à bottle of water... We are happy.
Restaurant is ok, a bit expansive for what it is but in this little town hard to find else.

Review 1 : So hotel is good to stay with family. plus point, they have parking inside their premises. When you will enter fatehpur sikri you will be asked to park your vehicle in city parking, just tell them you have booked this hotel and they will allow you to enter.
Food is nice, no non veg so plan accordingly. Overall a decent place to stay in Fatehpur Sikri.
It's just near the fort and you can see fort from rooftop.

Location is perfect.
Food is good but high priced.

I ordered Aloo parantha and curd, I was served 4 different pieces of aloo parantha, which were left out of some other customer, When GM called chef for clarification, he said he prepared 2 paranthas and gave me 4 pieces out of 8, I said show me remaining 4 pieces, He started shouting and said that He had already consumed those remaining pieces in just 2 mins... Those paranthas were stinking as those were left out of last night.

Review 1 : this room is not worth ... per night.
They provide you the smallest possible room where you can't even move around the bed. it is that tight. very small bed.
wash basin is outside of bathroom. bathroom is like a match box.
food is ok ok. but you can't order from your room because there is no place in the room for eating. so everytime you want to have breakfast, lunch or dinner you must have to go to the restaurant and here they take the longest possible time to get your food.
This hotel room is enough to spoil your holidays. MUST BE AVOIDED.

Only dampening thing is the poor and slow room service which is absolute spoiler. 45 mins to serve tea, an hour to serve fresh fries. By this time we gave up idea to have dinner itself..!!
Only recriational activity is the pool at the central part of resort.
Resort is amazing in monsoon with water flowing across the breath of the resort.
Review 2 : Cotton Stays at Bashos is located in the midst of beautiful green surroundings. The place makes for an excellent getaway especially during the rains when you can see the clouds descend on the hills around the resort. The resort would benefit from providing a recreation room and have some games like table tennis, carrom, snooker etc for families. The food quality can also be improved.

1. My bed wasn't ready when I arrived as it hasn't been cleaned and I had to wait.
2. The dormitory or the room in which I stayed was littered- It could have been due to the inmates as well
3. I found a centipede on my bed one night.

Review 1 : The food in the hotel was too good - quite a lot of varieties were offered during breakfast, lunch and dinner. The swimming pool was big and clean as well. The recreation room had indoor games like carrom, pool table, chess, ludo, snakes and ladders, squash and also had a gym. There was a basket ball court just opposite to the restaurant. The ambience was too good during the evening time. The staff was cordial and their service was awesome. Overall, it is highly recommended to visit this place.
Amenities, food, room - in short each and everything.
Review 2 : very nice resort to stay with family. we celebrated our Anniversary here and it was all worth the money. beautiful clean rooms, tasty food (Pure Veg) with many indoor games you can enjoy. Gym, Spa everything is there so u can spend a good time here.

Review 1 : Quite decent place to stay with family. Nice and clean rooms with a extra drawing room and a large bathroom.
Nice surrounding and 10 min walking distance to a nice and clean varsoli beach. in house restaurant also good with a very nice and coordial staff. Special mention for reception staff and Manas from room service/restaurant team
Safe place to stay. Large spacious rooms, small garden for kids with a small but nicely maintained swimming pool.
Review 2 : This place is at nice location, close to varsoli beach. very peaceful environment. Food is good with reasonable prices. We liked the complementary breakfast where the variety of food was on point to what one will feel to eat in the morning.
Staff is very friendly and are very humble in talking to visiters.
The room were very spacious and clean although the TV connection was not working but doesn't matter to us as we were not there to watch tv rather enjoy the beaches.

Review 2 : Only good thing with this cottage is location, my only suggestion to other travellers is don't go by high ratings of this cottage it seems to be fake, the hotel was full of insects even they have kept the bed on some distance with the wall to avoid insects, washrooms are worst and the room are full of seepage so you can get other food options in this budget..

- However, we found blankets & bedsheet had stain marks, but they gave a new one immediately.
- Did not provide soaps or handwash in the room, but washrooms were clean
- AC was cooling good
- Blankets had some dust on it, my wife is a bit sensitive to dust and she didn't find it comfortable
- Provided they give necessary washroom utilities and clean bedsheets, it would have been a great experience.
- Hotel was secured
- Near to Mandir. 10/- per person to Mandir
- Service was good. Staff was helpful

This property is 10 years old but we couldn't believe, very well maintained. Taken care by the owner and his family. clean rooms , good ambience, around 100 trees on the property which adds to the beauty, They have their own water sports team. Just 1 min walk to reach the cleanest Beach in malvan.
You can enjoy the Sunset from Rock Garden @ walking distance
Romantic beach , sunset point at walking distance
Review 2 : Had a very pleasant stay at Rosary House. Staff is very polite and Helpful. Rooms are extremely clean. Very close to clean Chivla Beach. Don't opt for breakfast(extra 300rs) when booking since not many options are available and it's not unlimited. Otherwise it is a quite and calm place to enjoy with family and friends. All water sports activity are available on Chivla beach.

Pure Veg restaurant is exceptional with Breakfast of best possible quality and have no complaints.
Only issue was the bathroom which need facelift with new fittings and bathtub etc is outdated as well as non functional. Bathroom should be spacious and unclustered. Simple Hanging WC + Wash Basin and Bath Cubicle will be more than enough. Property need to give attention to facelift bathrooms.
Overall stay was peaceful and excellent.

Staffs are courteous. You can find the parking spot behind the hotel.
There are no attached restaurant with this hotel. But they will bring food from outside. It's also costly. But you can find different restaurants near by
The only problem I faced was the WiFi connectivity provided by the hotel is very pathetic.
I didn't liked the WiFi connectivity provided by the hotel. Really very slow...

- Room service was very prompt.
- Location is good, easy to find (within city but not on crowded main road).
- Last but not the least, complementary breakfast was too good(with lots of options).
Note: Only thing that worth mentioning after so many positives was that I find food was way too expensive
in restaurant.
Overall it was a great experience and would recommend to anyone whoever is planning for a trip to Chikmagalur.

Review 1 : I had a very pleasant one night stay at the Woodstock Villas resort and was completely happy and satisfied with all the services. The premises is just how it shows in the pictures and located at a nice scenic place. Rooms are clean and service is super fast. The food is good, especially the breakfast which is outstanding. Overall, perfect 10/10 experience. True value for money. Only issue is if check in time could have been earlier by 11 AM or so.

Restaurant serves good food. Rooms are not that great. I got studio room which got black ants at night. As the location is in jungle so that was obvious but they could have taken care of those.

Review 1 : Extremely worst stay ever. First of all the address provided by ABC Aiyyas Home Stay is not correct. We arrived Ooty at around 11:30 night and when reached the address provided, the home stay people mentioned that the address is incorrect.
When reached the correct address, the home stay people didn't even open the gate. The rooms in the home stay were already booked. So the owner managed to get a room in nearby hotel.
Next day we got a room in Aiyyas cottage.
How terrible was it to me, I hav ...more
Review 2 : 3star bcz of location(near bus stand), otherwise would have given 2star. I was actually made to stay at a different place, except pillow cover and bedsheet, nowhere else cottage name was written. Basic toileteries like soap(at least to wash hands), hand towel were missing, not even a dustin in the room. It was a room with bed and TV. The price they are charging is much more than the services provided(no service at all,, not even once did anyone come to ask if we need anything). There were 2boys to let ppl come in and handover the keys, no one else.

Rooms are big and all of them have a dressing area and okayishly big bathroom. Located very near to the Tala gate but road is not in good condition so it takes 8-10 minutes to reach the gate before each drive. Service was great, staff was very courteous and food was homely.

In the middle of the lawn lie the stairs that lead you up to your room. The dining area is pretty decent. Quantity of food is little less for the price they take. Management can be improved a bit. There are generally only few people around if you need help.Overall a decent stay.

But it seems that Hotel is established a long time back and furniture items etc. are also placed in rooms etc. a long time back although efforts are made to maintain these. The bathroom can be more spacious as due to mirror wall in washroom it is a little conjusted. Overall a good hotel and will recommend it to all for a comfortable stay at Jabalpiur.

I would recommend the hotel for stay as the rooms are good, spacious, clean and service is extremely prompt

Review 1 : Well this is my 3rd Visit to Kasauli in last 4 years...During every visit have stayed at Whispering Winds Villa, Dharampur....the location of the Homestay is perfect for the people working in corporate to soothe their nerves & relax their mind...the only noise you will hear at this property will be of Birds chirping their heart out & of Kalka Shimla Toy train as the track is very close.... Also, property is surrounded by enough pine trees that brings the fresh air out all the time.

Review 2 : Genuinely It is a Great place with stunning views.
Very nice staff and Hospitality.
We stayed for one night. We had booked premium room, which was actually good. But, we upgraded the room to second floor. So we could enjoy our private terrace. Gradually, it rained ice. The host provided us with extra blankets and Room heater.
The food was very fresh and very tasty.
We faced car parking issues because parking area is not ready. Overall great experience.
Great for couple outings. Very cooperative staff and host.

Room size good but had dirty towel (which i tipped room boy and got it changed), smelly loo and old blankets which were smelling. Water issues and only when a water jeep came did we all get water in loos. that said, lovely view from balcony. i ordered Zomato for dinner as these guys don't have inhouse kitchen

The sleeping room with water imprints which was big enough for someone to definitely note. The bathroom was with a damaged and sealed bathtub.

The hotel is also close to White Town which consists of most of the places there are to visit in Pondicherry.

Review 1 : Good place to stay in Pondicherry as it's close to all major tourist destinations. Friendly staff especially Mr Abdul Basit from Restaurant department , breakfast was good. Mr Shiva from housekeeping department , upon request changed room within 5 mins.
Standard AC rooms are compact , ideal for 2 members. toiletries & Tea items including glasses were missing, only Electric Kettle & soap was provided, this can add further to customer delight.
Overall experience from all 9 family members was good. Thank you team Tamizh, All the best.
Review 2 : It was good experience. Rooms are neat and clean. Standard rooms are bit small its impossiable to accomdate the 3rd person.

Review 1 : We booked an imperial room and the room size was quite big. The restaurant section in the hotel was good. Getting hot water is a big problem here as the hotel management claims that they switch on the geyser only morning and evening for few hours. The hotel is located in a central location in close proximity to railway station and bus stand. The room service needs to be improved and at least basic amenities like hair dryer should be provided inside the room.
Review 2 : food don't have variety for north Indian ppl. south Indian food is good. room service is okay. rooms are clean. nice location.
rooms are not enough spacious. except premium rooms other rooms don't have any direct ventillation. no direct sunlight, no direct air, no view of outside and no window. have to spend time within the room only.

Review 2 : Location of the hotel is good. Cleanliness & service timeliness & quality is good. But the check-in experience & staff at reception need to do a better job. Room offered to us initially was right above their banquet hall with loud thumping music causing a lot of disturbance. After 3 calls to reception and asking for this to be escalated to manager we were finally offered a room on the higher floor. The changed room was better. Restaurant is good- good value for money & courteous staff. Breakfast buffet especially South Indian food was fine. Overall stay was fine.

Review 1 : It was a pleasant stay at four points sheraton vizag. Their services are excellent and front desk staff specially Mr Soutik helped through our check in process and was very kind in giving us a free upgrade and late check out facility. Overall a very good experience. Thanks to their team.
Review 2 : Good. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. They tried making it a comfortable stay for us. Located in the middle of the city somewhere, everything is nearby - good eating joints, shopping places and beach.
The hotel is well equipped with gym, spa etc. even the location is an added advantage.

Review 1 : firstly I have to say abt the pool.....it was just 👌👌👌😍💃🥰.... maintenance was nyc...room service, housekeeping,wifi,ambience,food, everything was nyc...best part of the hotel is....5mins walk to radhanagar beach..best place to stay and njoy in havelock
Review 2 : The room and breakfast were good. The food at the cafe was good too. The bar was reasonable. In our three day stay, however, the room was not cleaned at all, not once. The staff is courteous, but I think one needs to request room cleaning whereas at other resorts, it is done frequently.
The resort is located very close to the Radhanagar beach. There are also plenty of options to rent bikes.
Overall a positive experience.

Review 1 : overall it was a nice experience.good rooms,clean bathroom and good room service.Walking distance from railway station .
Review 2 : The hotel is just 100 m away from platform no 6. If you are traveller then you can stay for one or two days. Hotel is good... restaurant food is also good. Cleaning services and other services need to be improved. It's near to railway station so train's noise is also one factor we have to consider before Booking the room. For solo travelers, it would be good option.
It was good experience. However service needs to be improved and sometimes speedy response is also needed. Staff was cooperative b ...more

Review 1 : A very nice hotel. Located in main city and very near to railway station. Railway station is around 1Km and airport is around 3.5Km. Nice ambiance and prompt service. Food is excellent. Breakfast spread is very good. Recommended for business and tourists. Very safe and comfortable for families.
Review 2 : Location is good, good amenities. However the corridor which leads to room is little narrow and from reception to room you have to walk like 200 meters. Best part of the hotel is it's service. So overall Recommended.

Review 1 : Central location but outdated rooms and toilets that require renovation to meet modern standards. Tariff is high considering room furnishings and amenities. Avoid rooms facing the busy road as traffic noise is quite disturbing. Food is good and staff is courteous & helpful. Complimentary breakfast is ok. Cleanliness of rooms needs to be improved. Towels and bed sheets are clean
Good place..
Review 2 : Location is very good, Situated near to kalpna square. neat and clean room, room service is excellent, Delicious food and fast seevice however food is little bit costly. safe and secure hotel for faimly trip.

Rating : 4
Review 1 : We stayed here for one night. Very comfortable place. Location though outside the city centre, it hardly takes 20 minutes to the city and to the airport. Modern indoors with beautiful piece of art displayed all over. Room was extra spacious. Breakfast was good. Workers there were very helpful and courteous. One way complimentary airport transfer is an added bonus. Loved the stay. Would definitely stay here while visiting Bhubaneswar next time.
Review 2 : The hotel staff does not understand english unless you talk to higher management. No soap in the washroom and you can just forget about the hot water. Even the GM is not available in the hotel to figure things out. Experience has been very poor. Would not recommend this place. Only upper management of restaurant or duty manager are helpful

Review 1 : Mayfair Lagoon is the best property in Bhubaneswar for a quiet break from the mundane. The location is easy to access, has plenty of parking space, a fine green cover, and wonderful staff. The rooms are spacious, plush and extremely well appointed. Every room has a feel of an independent cottage, with fullest privacy and comfort. A great place to be in.
Review 2 : Excellent ambience, superb service and outstanding hospitality. Indeed a home away from home. Really unforgettable experience. Impressive greenery and decoration really highly appreciable. Its really living in a lagoon. Excellent in every respect.

Review 1 : HPR have always been a great choice for me whenever I visit Ranchi. I am staying in HPR from so long. But this time it was more amazing because I booked deluxe and got super deluxe 😁😁😁😁😁 room was very much spacious and I enjoyed a lot and thats why I am writing this review. And one more thing, whatever you order from the restaurant of HPR, you won't regret, the food is amazing. I am eating here since 2 years and the taste and quality is still same and the best. 🤩🤩
