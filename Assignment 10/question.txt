Consider a Kohonen network with 100 neurons arranged in the form of a two-dimensional lattice with 10 rows and 10 columns . 

The network is required to classify two-dimensional input vectors such that each neuron in the network should respond only to the input vectors occurring in its region. 

Train the network with 1500 two-dimensional input vectors generated randomly in a square region in the interval between -1 and +1. Select initial synaptic weights randomly in the same interval  (-1 and +1  ) and take the learning rate parameter Î± is equal to 0.1.

Test the performance of the self organizing neurons using the following

Input vectors:

X1=[0.1  0.8]T,  X2=[0.5  -0.2]T, X3=[-0.8  -0.9]T, X4=[-0.0.6  0.9]T.
