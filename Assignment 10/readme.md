Code by Prateek Mishra, IIT2018199 IIIT-Allahabad.

In this code I have implemented a Kohonen network with 100 neurons arranged in 
the form of a two-dimensional lattice with 10 rows and 10 columns. I have trained
the network with 1500 1500 two-dimensional input vectors generated randomly in
a square region in the interval between -1 and +1. Finally I have tested the 
performance with the following input vectors:
Test the performance of the self organizing neurons using the following
Input vectors:
X1=[0.1 0.8], X2=[0.5 -0.2], X3=[-0.8 -0.9], X4=[-0.06 0.9]

*Instructions:
1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Compile it in any python python compiler.
3. Tweak with the training and testing data and observe the changes in the output.
